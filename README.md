# Digit-based Multiplication
Research and development of a new algorithm for learning.

This project introduces a structured method of multiplication built directly on digits, 
breaking down numbers into elemental parts and recombining them through clear rules. 
It aims to simplify calculation, highlight the hidden order within arithmetic, and 
offer an alternative perspective on how numbers interact. 

Beyond mathematics, the method reflects a philosophy of clarity and process: 
deconstructing complexity into simple, repeatable steps.
